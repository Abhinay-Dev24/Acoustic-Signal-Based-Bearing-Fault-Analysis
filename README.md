# Overview
This repository hosts the project on acoustic signal-based bearing fault analysis of a Three Phase Induction Motor using IIR and Wiener filters. The project aims to identify and 
analyze bearing faults under varying load conditions using advanced signal processing techniques.

# Project Description
The project utilizes acoustic signals to diagnose bearing faults in three-phase induction motors. Techniques such as Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter and Wiener filter are employed 
to enhance the signal quality, enabling effective fault detection under half-load and full-load conditions. This analysis helps in understanding the health and performance changes in 
induction motors, which is crucial for maintaining the reliability and safety of industrial machinery.
